## ðŸš€ About Me
Hello! My name is Eyezek (pronounced like Isaac "ai-zek") and I am a frontend developer with a passion for learning. I began my journey in April 2022 and have been hooked ever since. I love the process of bringing ideas to life and solving problems through code. I am constantly looking to improve my skills and knowledge, and I have no intention of slowing down. Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. I hope you find my projects interesting and informative.
